# heatin?

it's some kind of HWMonitor clone for linux. right now it only shows the sensor input data from lm-sensors. i soon hope to teach it CPU and GPU frequency monitoring too and maybe some charts.

you will need:

* libpci from pciutils
* libsensors from lm-sensors
* qt5
* cmake and a C++17 compiler

clone and download [libsensors-cpp](https://github.com/sfranzen/libsensors-cpp):

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/flatulation/heatin.git
$ cd heatin
$ git submodule update --init
```

build:

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make # in parallel use -j and your number of cores plus one
```

install from build dir:

```
# make install
```

alternatively use cmake's amazing build capabilities:

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build/ --parallel
$ cmake --install build
```
